Smart Helmet for Two-Wheeler Safety

Introduction:

This repository contains the code and resources for the development and deployment of a smart helmet aimed at enhancing safety and convenience for two-wheeler riders. Road accidents, particularly involving two-wheelers, are a significant concern in India, leading to numerous fatalities and disabilities. This project seeks to mitigate these risks by integrating advanced technology into the helmet itself, offering real-time navigation, emergency notifications, accident detection, and other safety features.

Features:

GPS-Enabled Navigation: Integration with Google Maps provides riders with real-time navigation assistance, helping them find optimal routes and avoid traffic congestion.

Emergency Notifications: In the event of an accident, the helmet connects to the rider's smartphone via Bluetooth and sends notifications to predefined contacts, including family, friends, and nearby hospitals, facilitating swift assistance.

Safety for Female Riders: Female riders can activate an emergency button on the helmet for instant help, addressing concerns of harassment and unforeseen situations. Solar charging ensures continuous functionality, even during power outages.

Accident Handling: Post-accident, the helmet automatically sends an SMS to the nearby police station with the biker's position, streamlining emergency response and aiding accident investigations.

Sensor-Based Accident Detection: Incorporating a vibration sensor, the helmet identifies accidents by detecting impact exceeding a certain threshold, ensuring prompt assistance. Over-speeding alerts are also provided to enhance safety.

Incorporating Multiple Sensors for User Safety: Utilizing various sensors, including an FSR sensor to detect helmet usage and prevent ignition if not worn, and an alcohol sensor to deter drunken riding by preventing ignition and sending alerts.

GPS Tracking and Emergency Alerts: Leveraging GPS technology for real-time tracking, emergency alerts are sent to predefined contacts in case of accidents, along with precise location details for swift assistance.

Solar Charging Mechanism: A solar panel integrated into the helmet ensures continuous charging, utilizing renewable energy to sustain functionality, particularly during power outages.

Bluetooth Connectivity: Establishing Bluetooth communication between the helmet and the rider's smartphone enables necessary notifications, accident alerts, and communication with emergency services.
